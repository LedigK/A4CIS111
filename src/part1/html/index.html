                Review by Katharine Ledig
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="body1">
            <p>While perhaps best remembered as the movie in which Angelina Jolie
                and Brad Pitt became star-crossed lovers, <i>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</i>
                deserves more attention than your typical A-list action movie.
                In particular, the film’s trenchant critique of suburbia, marriage,
                and the lies we tell each other every day make it a relevant,
                contemporary movie. </p>
            <p>As the film is now almost 10 years old, I will be revealing some
                mild spoilers in this review, but it should not be enough to
                disturb enjoyment of the movie.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="body2">
            <h4 id="h4">A Slow Death In Suburbia</h4>
            <p>The very first scene of the movie with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie)
                Smith features them in the modern suburban torture chamber:
                therapy in the office of a marriage counselor. While denying
                that they need any kind of help (“Just a maintenance checkup”
                John claims) it is obvious that they are deeply uncomfortable
                in each other’s presence, a rawness helped by the fact that this
                was the first scene shot in the film. <a href="#footer">*</a></p>
            <p>As told in flashback, the couple originally met under dramatic and
                emotionally heightened circumstances in Panama, framing both their
                attraction and the cause of their self-destruction. Each is an
                assassin for a rival company, but instinctively uses their cover
                as a civilian contractor from the moment they meet, successfully
                fooling each other for the first six years of their relationship.
                It is this same deceit that threatens the end of their marriage.</p>
            <p>In this way the film is very similar to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111503/"><i>True Lies</i></a>, the action-comedy
                film directed 10 years earlier by James Cameron. However, in that
                film the deceit was almost entirely one-sided, the manipulation
                significantly more disturbing, and (being a Cameron- Schwarzenegger film)
                focused much more on spectacle.</p>
            <p>While seeing each other as equals, it quickly becomes apparent that
                John and Jane are very different people. Jane is reserved, precise,
                analytical, poised; her husband is rough-and-tumble, raw and
                improvisational. Every remaining bit of their energy is devoted to
                maintaining a successful cover: a fine house, the latest model cars.
                but it is only in danger and risk that they come alive: life in suburbia
                is boredom and ennui, and it’s clear that they can’t wait to escape the
                prison they have built for themselves each day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="body3">
        <h5 id="h5">Marching Orders</h5>
            <p>When their respective employers discover who they work for, John and Jane
                are set to kill each other. While these first attempts fail, the seething
                resentment of both wife and husband fuels a series of mounting revenge
                attacks. Their destruction comes almost gleeful – you can see them
                actually <i>enjoying</i> themselves in competition with each other – and
                ultimately frees them from the web of lies they have spun.</p>

                />
            </p>
            <p>Having failed in eliminating their rival, the previously inimical
                companies contracting John and Jane temporarily put aside their
                differences to end the problem of the Smiths, driving them closer
                together in survival instinct. The last third of the movie is the
                fight of John and Jane against the joined forces of their companies,
                culminating in a final showdown reminiscent of the climax in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064115/"><i>Butch
                Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</i></a></p>

        <h6 id="h6">Conclusion</h6>
            <p>While it is not without its faults (in particular Vincent Vaughn’s
                misogynistic, eternally frustrated character has become all too
                familiar in too many movies), Mr. & Mrs. Smith also has a significant
                share of charm. The chemistry between Pitt and Jolie is natural and
                unfeigned, and the film mixes great action sequences with a barded
                critique of modern suburban life, and it remains, on the whole, one
                of my favorite films.</p>
            <p>Rating: ★★★★★</p>

            <p>* (Sadly, the rest of the film was not shot chronologically:
                I was feel that doing so imparts an extra emotional verisimilitude
                to an actor’s performance, as they can express the emotional arc
                of their character in the same sequence that the audience experiences it.</p>
